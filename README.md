# drum_trig_seq_6ch
In this project is a 10HP module 6 channel trig sequencer from Hagiwo, but with the addition of me matrix keyboard 4x4 to control the steps of the sequences, the code is very raw and not attractive but WORKABLE, sketch uses 97% of the resource arduino nano. 

For matrix key i used this pins : 
[ROWS] = {4, 11, 0, 1};
[COLS] = {A0, A1, A2, A3};
